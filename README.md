## Future

1. We could potentially scout around Singapore to gather data on prices of food and other utilities in Singapore. 
Then, we can use the app itself to suggest cheap options in the vicinity ⇒ automating the hassle of finding the cheapest option

2. Expand UI to include more languages ⇒ cater to a bigger migrant worker population from many different cultural and nationalities 
⇒ further expands inclusivity ; reduces inequalities

3. Restructure financial assessment - include questions more suitable to those specific demographics to get more tailored insights 
Provide financial planning suggestions and alerts based on the specific spending and earning categories and patterns of that demographic 
⇒ further expands inclusivity ; reduces inequalities
